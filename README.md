# sneakerBot

Have gulp installed globally
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Make sure and go into the folder of the bot you want to run and install:
```bash
cd yeezysupply
npm install
``` 

To start the bot just fill out the options.js file and run the following in a folder:
```bash
npm start
```

*the very final submit action in the script is commented out so you won't actually buy whatever shoes you put in until you uncomment that line in __index.js__.*
